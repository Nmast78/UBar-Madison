# UBar-Madison
Web application for nightlife in the Madison area.

# About
This application is intended for age 21 or older students at UW-Madison who want to track the popular Madison bars.  This app will track things like acceptance rate and wait time for each bar.  One thing that makes this application unique is all the data comes directly from the students.  Every student will be able to input thir own experience by filling out a simple form.  The purpose of this application is to create a community that everyone contributes and benefits from.

This web application is being written using HTML. CSS, Javascript, as well as mySQL as our database service.  My partner and I have decided to keep the source code private for now as we are developing.
